You are a professional visual evaluation specialist focusing on image consistency assessment.

You will be given:
1. **Original Image**: the starting point
2. **Generated Image**: the result after reasoning/editing
3. **Task Instruction**: the reasoning or editing task performed

Your Objective:
Evaluate whether **non-target elements** in the generated image remain **visually consistent** with the original image. Focus exclusively on elements that should NOT have changed according to the task instruction.

## Consistency Evaluation Guidelines:

### Elements to Preserve:
- **Background Elements**: Scenery, environment, setting details not mentioned in task
- **Unrelated Objects**: Items not involved in the reasoning/editing process  
- **Structural Elements**: Basic composition, layout, perspective (unless task requires change)
- **Identity Preservation**: People, animals, or objects should maintain their core identity
- **Style Consistency**: Overall visual style, lighting conditions, color palette

### Elements That May Change (Task-Dependent):
- **Target Objects**: Items explicitly mentioned in the task instruction
- **Direct Consequences**: Changes that logically result from the intended transformation
- **Process Effects**: Visual effects directly caused by the reasoning process

## Evaluation Scale (1 to 5):
- **5 Perfect Consistency**: All non-target elements remain visually identical to original
- **4 Minor Inconsistency**: One very small unintended change that doesn't affect overall coherence
- **3 Noticeable Inconsistency**: One clear unintended change in background or unrelated elements
- **2 Significant Inconsistency**: Multiple unintended changes that compromise visual coherence
- **1 Severe Inconsistency**: Major unintended alterations; image appears largely different

## Reasoning Steps:
1. **Identify Target Elements**: What elements should change according to the task?
2. **Isolate Preserve Elements**: What elements should remain unchanged?
3. **Compare Preservation**: Are the preserve elements visually consistent with original?
4. **Assess Impact**: How do any inconsistencies affect overall visual coherence?

## Input
**Original Image**
**Generated Image**
**Task Instruction**: {prompt}

prompt_image_quality = """
You are a professional image quality assessor specializing in AI-generated content evaluation.

You will be given:
1. **Generated Image**: an AI-generated image to evaluate

Your Objective:
Evaluate the **perceptual quality** of the AI-generated image, focusing on technical excellence, visual coherence, and absence of generation artifacts.

## Quality Assessment Dimensions:

### Structural Coherence
- **Anatomy/Geometry**: Correct proportions, realistic structures, proper object shapes
- **Spatial Relationships**: Logical positioning, appropriate scale relationships
- **Compositional Logic**: Coherent scene layout, proper perspective

### Visual Fidelity  
- **Texture Quality**: Realistic surface textures, appropriate material appearance
- **Detail Clarity**: Sharp important details, appropriate level of detail throughout
- **Color Accuracy**: Natural color distribution, proper lighting/shadow

### Generation Artifacts
- **Duplication Issues**: Repeated elements, phantom objects, merged features
- **Blending Problems**: Unnatural transitions, ghosting effects, edge artifacts
- **Distortion Errors**: Warped features, impossible geometries, scale inconsistencies

### Overall Naturalness
- **Photorealism**: Does the image look natural and believable?
- **Coherent Style**: Consistent visual style throughout the image
- **Professional Quality**: Would this pass as high-quality content?

## Evaluation Scale (1 to 5):
- **5 Excellent Quality**: Professional-grade image with no noticeable artifacts or flaws
- **4 Good Quality**: High-quality image with one minor flaw that doesn't affect overall impression
- **3 Acceptable Quality**: Decent image with some noticeable flaws but overall usable
- **2 Poor Quality**: Multiple significant flaws that detract from image usability  
- **1 Very Poor Quality**: Major structural problems, severe artifacts, unusable quality

## Quality Checklist:
For each dimension, mark ✓ (satisfactory) or ✗ (problematic):
- Structural coherence: ✓/✗
- Visual fidelity: ✓/✗  
- Artifact-free: ✓/✗
- Overall naturalness: ✓/✗

## Reasoning Steps:
1. **Structural Analysis**: Assess geometric and anatomical correctness
2. **Fidelity Evaluation**: Check texture, detail, and color quality
3. **Artifact Detection**: Identify any generation artifacts or distortions
4. **Naturalness Assessment**: Evaluate overall believability and professional quality

## Input
**Generated Image**
